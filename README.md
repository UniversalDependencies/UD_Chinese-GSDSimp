# Summary

Simplified Chinese Universal Dependencies dataset converted from the GSD (traditional) dataset with manual corrections.

# Introduction

This is a simplified Chinese version of the UD Chinese GSD treebank. It is initially automatically converted into simplified Chinese with the OpenCC tool with patterns for mapping punctuation, then corrected with manual fixes.


# Changelog

* 2020-11-15 v2.7
  * Aspect markers relations are corrected from `case:aspect` to `aux:aspect`.

* 2019-11-15 v2.5
  * Initial release in Universal Dependencies, converted from UD_Chinese-GSD.
  * Google gave permission to drop the "NC" restriction from the license.
    This applies to the UD annotations (not the underlying content, of which Google claims no ownership or copyright).
  * Fixed punctuation (use East Asian punctuation where appropriate)
  * Fixed various parses and features (e.g., added Case=Ord)
  * Some manual fixes in tokenization
