# Summary

Simplified Chinese Universal Dependencies dataset converted from the GSD (traditional) dataset with manual corrections.

# Introduction

This is a simplified Chinese version of the UD Chinese GSD treebank. It is initially automatically converted into simplified Chinese with the OpenCC tool with patterns for mapping punctuation, then corrected with manual fixes.
